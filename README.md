# meteor-solidjs-data

This package provides helper functions for combining the reactive systems in
[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com),
in particular to make it easy to build reactive user interfaces with SolidJS
while getting data from Meteor.

`meteor-solidjs-data` is modeled after
[`meteor-react-data`](https://github.com/meteor/react-packages/tree/master/packages/react-meteor-data).
