# solidjs-meteor-data

This package provides helper functions for combining the reactive systems in
[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com) and [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com)<
in particular to make it easy to build reactive user interfaces with SolidJS
while getting data from Meteor.

`solidjs-meteor-data` is modeled after
[`react-meteor-data`](https://github.com/meteor/react-packages/tree/master/packages/react-meteor-data).
